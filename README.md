# Various AD-Hoc Scripts (Facebook API, Twitter API, S3 Bucket)

*fb_posts.py*
Cool little script which uses the Facebook GraphAPI to extract all the wall posts you have posted,
along with the amount of 'likes' (if any) it has recieved and the datetime you posted it.
It then inserts the data into a MySQL database table.
